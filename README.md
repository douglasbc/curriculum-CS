# Be a self-taught computer scientist
  
This is a repository with the study planning that my wife [Andressa](https://github.com/andressadotpy) and I have made.  Our goal was to plan the equivalent of an entire Computer Science undergraduate program, based on the [6-3: Computer Science and Engineering 2019 MIT Curriculum](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_roadmaps.pdf), with only freely available courses. Pretty much every lecture is from top notch Universities such as MIT, Stanford and UC Berkeley. We also added some extra lectures that we will be watching as a complement to our studies.  
  
The courses were divided in:
- Introductory
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Extras *

\* Extras not being included in the base MIT CS curriculum.
